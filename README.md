# Create a Docker image for React Start App.

This process mainly consists of two parts since this takes place only on a local server. 1.Build 2.Run

Use Docker Desktop for viewing the container logs.

### Build First the Dockerfile.dev is used to build the docker image

docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t mytag .

**Note: The dot at the end is required too.**

### Run Then create the container using the docker image using the followinf command

docker run -d -it -rm -p 3001:3000 -name reactapp mytag

https://localhost:3001
